This is a simple code for encrypting sensitive data and then decrypting it again.  
In this method, a new key is generated each time the function is called, making it impossible to recover the encrypted text without the encryption key.  
The code is written in such a way that even with access to the source code, recovering the encrypted data is nearly impossible.
